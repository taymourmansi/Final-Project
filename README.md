Tic-Tac-Toe
What?
An online Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to compete head to head in a client server model.
Why?
It is a good project for learning the fundamentals of an online connection, and fun at the same time.
How?
The game will use a TCP network connection to connect two players into one game, one player creating the server and the other connecting to it as a client. A standard 3 by 3 board will be use with standard live turn based action.
